# Uchicago Midway RCC Tutorial

This is a tutorial for using Uchicago Midway research computing center (RCC). 

*This tutorial was adapted from [RCC Website](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/docs/connecting/index.html). I highly recommend you to check out the website for detailed questions.*

## Connecting to RCC

### Connecting with SSH

SSH provides command-line access and interaction with the Midway2 computing cluster. For Linux and MacOS user, open the terminal and type in the command line

```
ssh <CNetID>@midway2.rcc.uchicago.edu
```

Please repalce `<CNetID>` with your own CNetID at Uchicago. Then enter the password associated to your ID when prompted for a password. A Duo two-factor autentication window will then pop up requesting you select from the available 2FA options to authenticate to midway2.
